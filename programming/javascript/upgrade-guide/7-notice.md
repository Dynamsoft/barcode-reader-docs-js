# Dynamsoft Barcode Reader JavaScript Edition Version 7.x Will Reach End of Support on December 31st 2023

First released on August 09th, 2019, Dynamsoft Barcode Reader JavaScript Edition Version 7.x (DBR JS 7) had 11 minor updates in total. Version 7.6.0 was the final version of DBR JS 7 and it was released on September 1st, 2020.

Based on Dynamsoft Lifetime Support Policy, Dynamsoft is committed to providing maintenance and support for all Dynamsoft product releases for TWO years from their general availability date.

DBR JS 7 was well accepted by hundreds of customers and we extended its maintenance and support after it had reached TWO years on August 31st, 2022. However, it will reach end of support by end of this year. This means that Dynamsoft will no longer be providing updates, bug fixes, or technical support for this version beyond 2023/12/31.

Since the date is fast approaching, our system will stop serving new licenses for DBR JS 7, including validity extensions or quota extensions. The license server that supports DBR JS 7 will be taken offline by end of 2024. If you already have a license for DBR JS 7 beyond that time and would like to keep using it, you can [contact us](https://www.dynamsoft.com/contact/).
