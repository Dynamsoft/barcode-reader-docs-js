## Always draw a square as the scan region

When reading square barcodes such as QR codes, it will help to keep the scan region also a square, the following code does the trick

```javascript
scanner.onPlayed = async info => {
    let sideLen = Math.min(info.width,info.height)*0.4;
    let precentW = Math.round(sideLen/info.width*100)
    let precentH = Math.round(sideLen/info.height*100);
    let rs = await scanner.getRuntimeSettings();
    rs.region.regionLeft = (100 - precentW) / 2;
    rs.region.regionRight = (100 + precentW) / 2;
    rs.region.regionTop = (100 - precentH) / 2;
    rs.region.regionBottom = (100 + precentH) / 2;
    rs.region.regionMeasuredByPercentage = 1;
    await scanner.updateRuntimeSettings(rs);
}
```

## Account for newline characters in the barcode result

When it comes to HTML, newline characters ( `\n` ) are not interpreted as they normally would. Therefore, if a barcode result contains a newline character, and you display the result in an modal dialogue box or some other text elements, then the newline character will probably be ignored.

> *NOTE*
>  
> For efficiency, the library may utilize WebGL (Web Graphics Library) for preprocessing an image before passing it to the barcode reader engine. If WebGL is used, the image captured from the camera will not be rendered on the canvas, instead, it gets processed by WebGL first and then is passed to the barcode reader engine directly. In this case, there won't be an original canvas.

## Hosting the library

### Step One: Deploy the dist folder

Once you have downloaded the library, you can locate the "dist" directory and copy it to your server (usually as part of your website / web application). 

Some of the files in this directory:

* `dbr.js` // The main library file
* `dbr.mjs` // For using the library as a module (`<script type="module">`)
* `dbr.ui.html` // Defines the default scanner UI
* `dbr-<version>.worker.js` // Defines the worker thread for barcode reading
* `dbr-<version>.wasm.js` // Compact edition of the library (.js)
* `dbr-<version>.wasm` // Compact edition of the library (.wasm)
* `dbr-<version>.full.wasm.js` // Full edition of the library (.js)
* `dbr-<version>.full.wasm` // Full edition of the library (.wasm)

### Step Two: Configure the Server

* Enable HTTPS

  Due to the browser <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts" title="security restriction">security restriction</a> on camera video streaming access, a secure HTTPS connection is required to use the library with camera.

  > For convenience, self-signed certificates can be used during development and testing.
### Step Three: Include the library from the server

Now that the library is hosted on your server, you can include it accordingly.

```html
<script src="https://www.yourwebsite.com/dynamsoft-javascript-barcode/dist/dbr.js"></script>
```
Optionally, you may also need to [specify the location of the "engine" files](index.md#specify-the-location-of-the-engine-files).
