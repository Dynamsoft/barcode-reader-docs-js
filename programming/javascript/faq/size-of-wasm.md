# What is the size of the JavaScript SDK (.wasm)?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

The total size of the JS SDK is 19.1 MB accounting for the total `dist` folder.

> Note - This size is for DBR JS alone and doesn't take into account the DCE package which is around 317 KB.

If the size of the SDK after compilation is too large, you could try shrinking the size of the library by switching to the compact engine. To learn of the differences between the full and compact engine of the library, and how to switch between the two, please refer to this [article](differences-between-full-and-compact-editions.md).
