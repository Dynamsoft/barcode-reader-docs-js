# Release Notes for Dynamsoft Barcode Reader JavaScript SDK

## 10.0.20 (01/29/2024)

### Changelog

In this version, the SDK has been refactored under the `DynamsoftCaptureVision` (DCV) architecture. To learn more about the architecture, please see [Architecture of Dynamsoft Capture Vision](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/core/architecture/){:target="_blank"}. The following highlights the major changes:

* The class `BarcodeReader` and `BarcodeScanner` are removed and its functionalities are now incorporated into the newly added Class `CaptureVisionRouter`.

* License-related functions are handled by class [Dynamsoft.License.LicenseManager]({{ site.dcv_js_api }}license/license-manager.html#initLicense).

* Camera-related functions are handled by [DynamsoftCameraEnhancer(DCE)](https://www.dynamsoft.com/camera-enhancer/docs/web/programming/javascript/){:target="_blank"}. Please note that the following features are grouped together as enhanced features that require a license:
  * Enhanced-focus.
  * Auto-zoom.
  * Tap-to-focus.

* This version of `BarcodeReader` only accepts `DynamsoftCameraEnhancer(DCE)` version 4.0.1 and above, which has been refactored to be compliant with the [ImageSourceAdapter (ISA) interface](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/core/architecture/input.html#image-source-adapter){:target="_blank"}, as a valid image source.

* Decoded barcode results are returned via the [CapturedResultReceiver (CRR) interface](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/core/architecture/output.html#captured-result-receiver){:target="_blank"}.
